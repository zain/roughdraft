# Roughdraft

A local-first markdown editor and viewer for working with AI.

Open any markdown file on your machine. Review it, comment on it, suggest edits, and keep the file in plain markdown on disk.

```bash
npm i -g roughdraft
roughdraft open /absolute/path/to/file.md
```

## What is this?

Roughdraft is a local-first markdown editor and viewer that runs on your computer.

Its job is to make markdown files easy to open, read, edit, review, and discuss with your AI agent without moving them into a proprietary format or a hosted app.

You can open a single markdown file directly or open a folder, browse its markdown files, and review each document with CriticMarkup comments and suggested changes.

## How it works

*   **Local-first markdown editor** — Open normal `.md` files from your machine and edit them directly
    
*   **Works with your AI agent** — Tell your local agent to open a file in Roughdraft on your computer, then keep collaborating from there
    
*   **Comments & suggested changes** — Use CriticMarkup for inline feedback, revisions, and review conversations
    
*   **Folder browsing** — Open a folder of docs, pick a markdown file from the sidebar, and keep your review focused on the active document
    
*   **Markdown files on disk** — Everything stays as regular markdown files you can also edit in VS Code, Vim, Cursor, or anywhere else
    
*   **No cloud, no account, no telemetry** — Runs entirely on your machine
    

## Quick start

```bash
npm i -g roughdraft
roughdraft start
```

`roughdraft start` runs Roughdraft in the background, reuses or chooses a free localhost port, writes server state to `~/.roughdraft/server.json`, prints the active URL, and exits while the server keeps running.

Open a specific project folder:

```bash
roughdraft open ./path/to/my-essay
```

Open a specific markdown file directly:

```bash
roughdraft open ./path/to/my-essay/draft.md
```

Check or stop the background server:

```bash
roughdraft status
roughdraft stop
```

`roughdraft open` will reuse the running server and auto-start it if needed.

Roughdraft does not edit `~/CLAUDE.md`, `~/AGENTS.md`, or other user-level agent files. If you want your agent to remember the workflow, ask it to update its own guidance.

If the local server is already running, you can also open a folder or file directly by URL:

```text
http://localhost:3000/absolute/path/to/my-essay
http://localhost:3000/absolute/path/to/my-essay/draft.md
```

That makes an agent-friendly workflow possible:

1.  Your AI writes or updates markdown files on disk.
    
2.  You tell it to open a file or folder in Roughdraft.
    
3.  Roughdraft opens locally on your machine.
    
4.  You read, edit, leave comments, and suggest changes.
    
5.  You tell the AI you are done, and it can respond to your comments or revise the document.
    

## Local development

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

`./scripts/setup.sh` installs workspace dependencies and builds the app and server. `./scripts/run.sh` serves the built app at `http://localhost:3000`.

The two scripts coordinate through a lock file, so it's safe to start `./scripts/run.sh` while `./scripts/setup.sh` is still in progress. `run` will wait for setup to finish, or trigger setup itself if nothing has been built yet.

If you prefer package scripts, the same commands are available as `pnpm setup` and `pnpm start`.

Running `pnpm setup` also installs a per-worktree dev CLI wrapper into `~/.local/bin` by default, using the current worktree directory name. For example, this checkout might install `roughdraft-dev-lyon-v2`, which points at this worktree's local code while leaving the published global `roughdraft` command untouched.

Each dev wrapper keeps its own server state under `~/.roughdraft/dev/<wrapper-name>` by default, so opening a file from one worktree will not accidentally reuse a backend started from another worktree. `roughdraft-dev-<worktree> open ...` can start its own background server as needed; you do not need to run `pnpm dev` first just to open files in Roughdraft.

You can refresh that wrapper manually with:

```bash
pnpm dev:install-cli
pnpm dev:install-cli --name api-redesign
```

Quality checks:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm check
```

`pnpm check` is the same command the pull request workflow runs before merge.

## What's in the folder

```
my-essay/
  draft-1.md            # A normal markdown file on disk
  draft-1-alt.md        # A variation you are reviewing
  draft-2.md            # Another page you can open directly
```

Every page is a regular markdown file. Roughdraft reads and writes those files directly.

## Agent setup

If you want your local agent to remember the Roughdraft workflow, point it at the commands and review loop explicitly:

```text
Use Roughdraft when I want to open, review, comment on, or compare markdown files.

Start it with `roughdraft start` if needed.
Open files or folders with `roughdraft open "/absolute/path/to/file.md"`.
After I finish reviewing in Roughdraft, continue by reading the markdown files from disk and making the requested changes there.
Use CriticMarkup for inline review feedback in markdown.
```

Use `roughdraft help` or `roughdraft help criticmarkup` if you need a refresher while setting that up.

## CriticMarkup

Roughdraft uses [CriticMarkup](https://criticmarkup.com) for inline annotations and revision workflows:

```markdown
This is {--deleted--} text.
This is {++inserted++} text.
This is {~~old~>new~~} substituted text.
This is {>>a comment<<} in the margin.
This is {==highlighted==} text.
This is {==anchored text==}{>>a threaded comment<<}{id="c1" by="user" at="2026-04-23T18:00:00.000Z"}.
```

This matters because the main workflow is often:

*   The AI writes a doc
    
*   The user opens it in Roughdraft
    
*   The user leaves comments and suggested changes
    
*   The AI reads those comments and responds in the same markdown file
    
*   The user and AI keep alternatives as normal markdown files in the same folder
